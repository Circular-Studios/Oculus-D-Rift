# Oculus-D-Rift

A D binding for the Oculus Rift.

## Using this Binding

This binding is definitely incomplete, and could use some help. It is able to successfully connect to and print the orientation of the device, but that's about it. Most methods that are missing are template instantiations, and those can be added relatively simply. For an example, see [this commit](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Oculus-D-Rift/commit/b45293c0ac1cf825973a89614400d41570f43eb0).
